		<h1>Bio and Resume</h1>
		<p><strong>BIO</strong></p>
<p>Linda Graham earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio with a major in Biology and a minor in Chemistry in 1960.</p>
<p>A year of medical school (1962-3) at Case-Western Reserve University was followed by years of childrearing and developing skills and knowledge about constructing, glazing and firing works in clay.</p>
<p>Her clay work was exhibited in Colorado during the 1980’s, while the 1990’s + was spent working to create a youth arts organization in Aurora, CO near Colfax Avenue and earning a masters of public administration from the University of Colorado Denver in 2001.</p>
<p>Linda says,</p>
<p>“In the summer of 1991, I joined a group interested in the creation of an arts organization in the Original Aurora area of Aurora. We explored the needs of the community as well as possible funding sources. I became deeply committed to establishing an organization to involve middle school students in this very needful area of the city in the making of art for the community. Our first project was a 20’ x 60’ Community Clay Tile Mural. I spent the next 12 years as founding director, volunteering when necessary, receiving a salary when available, “making art a part of community life.”</p>
<p>Downtown Aurora Visual Arts, widely known now as DAVA, was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1993 and continues today as a vital arts organization under the able directorship of Susan Jensen.</p>
<p>After exploring some computer based classes in the continuing education program at RMCAD (2003-7), Linda found the clay program under Martha Russo and continued to help in the clay program while auditing classes and exploring fine art options until the fall of 2013. In 2011 she discovered the fascinating qualities of plexiglass and has spent 2 years making sculptures using light and projections to express an interest in describing the complexities of our cosmos.</p>
<p>Linda now works in her home studio and exhibits at the Ice Cube Gallery in Denver.</p>
